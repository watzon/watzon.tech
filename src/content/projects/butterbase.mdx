# Butterbase

Butterbase is a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed for modern online stores. Built as a monorepo with separate frontend, backend, and shared packages, it provides a flexible foundation for e-commerce businesses of all sizes.

## Architecture

The project uses a sophisticated monorepo structure:

```
butterbase/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/     # Next.js storefront
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backend/      # NestJS API server
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared/       # Shared types and utilities
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ admin/        # Admin dashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mobile/       # React Native app
â””â”€â”€ tools/
    â””â”€â”€ cli/          # Development tools
```

## Key Features

### Headless Commerce API

```typescript
// Product catalog API
interface ProductAPI {
  getProducts(params: QueryParams): Promise<ProductPage>;
  getProduct(slug: string): Promise<ProductDetail>;
  searchProducts(query: string): Promise<SearchResult>;
}

// Shopping cart management
interface CartAPI {
  getCart(cartId: string): Promise<Cart>;
  addToCart(cartId: string, item: CartItem): Promise<Cart>;
  updateCartItem(cartId: string, itemId: string, quantity: number): Promise<Cart>;
  removeFromCart(cartId: string, itemId: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Multi-Store Support
- Single backend serving multiple storefronts
- Shared product catalog with store-specific pricing
- Centralized inventory management
- Store-specific themes and configurations

### Modern Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- React Query for server state

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express/NestJS
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Redis for caching
- Stripe for payments

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker containers
- Kubernetes deployment
- AWS/GCP cloud-native
- CDN integration

## Performance Optimizations

```typescript
// Intelligent caching strategy
const productCache = new Cache({
  ttl: '5m',
  staleWhileRevalidate: '1h',
  keyGenerator: (params) => `product:${JSON.stringify(params)}`
});

// Image optimization
const imageOptimizer = {
  sizes: [300, 600, 900, 1200],
  formats: ['webp', 'avif', 'jpg'],
  quality: 80
};
```

## Developer Experience

- **Hot reload** across all packages
- **Type safety** shared between frontend and backend
- **Automated testing** with Jest and Playwright
- **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions
- **Code quality** with ESLint, Prettier, and Husky
